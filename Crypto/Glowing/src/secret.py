plain = b'Afterglow is a hard rock band that is led by Himari Uehara and was formed after Ran Mitake was placed in a different class from the others in middle school. The five live by the creed of maintaining their friendship; in accordance with keeping their status quo, they have a "rough-around-the-edges" aesthetic and their music centers on their camaraderie. The name comes from the English term for the effect on the sky following a sunset, stemming from the friends regularly watching the sunset together.In the animes second season, Afterglow participates in a shopping district festival with PoppinParty, followed by the latters self-sponsored live. The band skips the Girls Band Challenge in the third season due to scheduling conflicts.
